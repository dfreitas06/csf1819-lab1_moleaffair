# The Mole Affair

### Forensics Cyber-Security - Lab 1

This assignment consists in analysing artifacts and search for evidence of industrial secrets that might be present in them.

For several years now, John Mole has been working for DroneX, a major manufacturer of drone technology. In the past few months, motivated by suspicious changes in Johnâ€™s behavior, DroneX started taking measures to investigate him. Since he had privileged access to the design plans of their new revolutionary drones, the fear was that he might be illicitly stealing those plans in order to sell them to competitors. To dissipate such fears, after obtaining legal counseling and authorization, DroneX assembled an auditing team to look for potential evidence of industrial espionage.
